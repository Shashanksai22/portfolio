The bot&#39;s navigation prowess is orchestrated through a network of infrared sensors strategically emitting light in all directions. This design choice allows the bot to discern the path, marked by a lack of light reflection, and embark on a journey of intelligent exploration.</p>

    The heart of the system lies in the implementation of a sophisticated Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. As the bot traverses the maze, it dynamically turns left, utilizing its infrared sensors to scrutinize the environment for unexplored paths. This iterative process continues until the optimal path is discerned. This project showcases not only the harmonious fusion of hardware and software but also highlights my commitment to pioneering innovative solutions in the field of robotics, amplifying the possibilities of AI-driven navigation and problem-solving.
